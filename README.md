# CLI-NASA

Welcome to the cli-nasa gem! This program is designed to allow individuals to
search through the NASA Image and Video Library to quickly find content displayed
by title and link URL. Users have the option to do a keyword search that returns
a wide variety of results, or a media-specific search for only audio, image, or
video files.

Once a user has selected a search and entered terms, they will have the ability
to view all related pieces of content as well as content-specific keywords &
descriptions.

## Installation

Clone or download this repository onto your machine. Once the files are
available locally, use your command line to navigate into the `cli-nasa` folder
and type `bin/run_me` to use CLI-NASA.

## Usage

Once the file is running, follow the provided prompts and list of commands
to access content and its associated data from the library. The main menu
provides the option to search by keyword for all types of media, or to search
for image, audio, or video content specifically.

Once a search has been made, users can interact with the title, description,
associated keyword, and a link to the content displayed on NASA.gov.
