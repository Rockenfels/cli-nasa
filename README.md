# Cli::Nasa

Welcome to the CLI-NASA gem! This program is designed to allow individuals to
search through the NASA Image and Video Library to quickly find content displayed
by title and link URL. Users have the option to do a keyword search that returns
a wide variety of results, or a media-specific search for only audio, image, or
video files.

Once a user has selected a search and entered terms, they will have the ability
to view all related pieces of content as well as content-specific keywords &
descriptions.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cli-nasa'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cli-nasa

## Usage

Once the file is running, follow the provided prompts and list of commands
to access content and its associated data from the library.

## Development
